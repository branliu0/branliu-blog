	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">The Education for a Successful Entrepreneur</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make the best use of my time,
given my circumstances and where I am in life, and one of the most important
things that I&rsquo;ve had to think about is the division of time between school and
entrepreneurship. Given that I&rsquo;m passionate about entrepreneurship and deeply
involved on campus, it would make sense for me to be spending much of my free
time working on projects, generating ideas, and practicing entrepreneurship.
After all, school is a wonderful time to work on a startup, because you don&rsquo;t
need to be making a salary, you have so many talented and ambitious peers, and
in the worst case of your startup failing, you can always fall back to your
schoolwork.</p>

<p>But this semester, I&rsquo;ve made a deliberate effort to cut down on my projects and
entrepreneurial activities in order to focus on schoolwork. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot
and there are many reasons why I&rsquo;ve made this decision to focus more on
schoolwork, and one of those reasons is that I believe entrepreneurship is
nothing more than a means to an end, and not an end in itself, as many think.</p>

<p>What is entrepreneurship? I love the practice of starting off these
definitional discussions with a Wikipedia quote.</p>

<blockquote><p>Entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be defined as<br/>&#8220;one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to<br/>transform innovations into economic goods&#8221;.</p></blockquote>


<p>Although not everyone may agree with this precise definition, at least it
serves to lend some concreteness to this notion of entrepreneurship that we are
discussing. But anyway, a precise definition is not necessary for what I want
to explore here.</p>

<p>So, given this definition, what does an entrepreneur need to know in order to
be successful? Yes, as according to Wikipedia&rsquo;s definition, business and
financial acumen are indeed needed. This is where many people see
entrepreneurship start and end: the business skills of building a product,
positioning yourself to a market, and growing a company as well as the
financial skills of raising money, managing capital, and turning profits. These
are all indeed the skills required of any competent entrepreneur, but I believe
that they are not the ones that lie at the heart of entrepreneurship. Just as
Disney may be incredible at designing amusement parks, creating animations, and
composing music, all those skills are secondary to what lies at the heart of
what Disney does and why it is so successful: making people happy by delivering
a magical experience.</p>

<p>If you are without a deep understanding the core of what you want to do and how
to do it, all the peripheral skills fall to the wayside and become meaningless.
And so I believe that becoming a successful entrepreneur isn&rsquo;t just about
attending workshops on raising your seed round of funding or mastering the art
of the pitch. The heart of entrepreneurship lies in innovation, in discovering
and understanding a problem that is deeply important to people to society. It
lies in having the foresight and vision to see the world differently and in
having the domain skills and expertise to forge the road ahead to create the
future you see. Every entrepreneur is passionate about a different problem and
has deep expertise in what they&rsquo;re working on, which is why there is no
entrepreneurial class or conference or forum out there that can tell you what
sort of innovation you should be working on and how you&rsquo;ll succeed. Only you
can find that on your own.</p>

<p>But that is what an education is for. You dive deep into a domain so that
you&rsquo;re prepared to be a leader in your field and to see what it&rsquo;s like to be at
the edge of human knowledge. You study history (not necessarily the history of
civilizations, but perhaps the history of other things, like technology) and
learn about the past so that you may better see into the future, because you
discover that history repeats itself. You study a breadth of subjects to know
more about the world we live in and you learn from the innovations in every
field because oftentimes the best innovations come from somewhere outside your
domain. You challenge yourself by studying hard theoretical subjects like math
or philosophy not for their applications, but because the intellectual rigor
will train your mind to be learn quickly, process rapidly, and see a bit
further into the future by understanding the implications of all that you are
exposed to.</p>

<p>This is why an education is important, especially for those who wish to be
successful in entrepreneurship and create something truly innovative &ndash;
something that requires foresight, knowledge, and lots of hard work. The other
skills have their place and their time to be learned, but you must focus on
what is important first. Successful entrepreneurs aren&rsquo;t lucky; they know
exactly what they are doing and they&rsquo;ve prepared for it, which is why they
succeed.</p>
