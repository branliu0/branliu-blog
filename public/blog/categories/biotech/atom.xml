    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending more time exploring the biotechnology startup world lately,
and it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see its many differences from the consumer web
startup world that I&rsquo;ve become familiar with. In particular, I&rsquo;ve noticed many
ways in which their executive teams differ in their structure and presentation
on websites.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to list some observations that I&rsquo;ve made, and then give
some explanations that will hopefully account for these observations. I&rsquo;ve
picked a few startup team pages that I&rsquo;ll be basing my observations on.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Observations</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Biotech startups have &lsquo;heftier&rsquo; titles. Web startups have much simpler
titles or no titles at all. The biotech startups have multiple C-level
executives, SVPs, VPs, and Directors. On the other hand, if you look at the web
startups, you sometimes can&rsquo;t even tell who the founders are.</p></li>
<li><p>Biotech startups show only the top-level executive and management teams. Web
startups tend to show their entire team, and they don&rsquo;t differentiate between
different roles. Technial and non-technical roles are all placed equally.</p></li>
<li><p>The images of all the biotech team members are taken in formal attire,
whereas all of the web startup team pictures are in informal clothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Biotech startups heavily emphasize the advanced degrees and educational
background of their management team. Most web startup team members don&rsquo;t have
advanced degrees, and educational background is often left out.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>The Differences</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The biggest difference between biotech and web startups that results in
these observations is size. In general, biotech startups need a lot more
manpower and funding than web startups to get off the ground. As a result,
these larger biotech startups require a larger management team to deal with a
multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and business people.</p></li>
<li><p>The problems that most biotech startups are deeper and more complex than
what the <strong>average</strong> web startup is working on. It seems that PhDs are
generally necessary to make the scientific breakthrough that will drive the
growth of a biotech startup. In contrast, many brilliant software engineers and
entrepreneurs don&rsquo;t even have a college degree! The average person probably
won&rsquo;t understand what a biotech startup is working on, but will have a pretty
good grasp of what most web startups are working on.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, the average age at a biotech startup is slightly older, as most
have completed advanced degree programs. This seems to lead to a slightly more
formal environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly all biotech startups have tight relationships with academic
institutions and large biomedical or pharmaceutical corporations, and as a
result, seem to be influenced by a more bureaucratic kind of culture.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>As I&rsquo;ve been learning about this biotech space, it&rsquo;s been interesting to notice
its differences from the web startup world. I&rsquo;ve only been looking into the
biotech startup for a few months now, and so I don&rsquo;t really know the
intricacies of how the biotech startup space looks like. As I continue to
explore this space further, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll continue to learn more and understand
better the influential factors that make biotech a very different space than
the Silicon Valley startup culture.</p>
