	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine introduced me to the amazing world of
<a href="http://littlebits.cc">littleBits</a>. I had been taking an electrical
engineering course last semester, spending lots of time in lab playing with
circuits, so I was especially excited to see such an innovative product that
made it so easy for kids to explore the world of electronics and build their
own toys out of them!</p>

<p>littleBits is like LEGOs for electronics: they have a variety of different
electrical components that snap together with magnetics to create all sorts of
different circuits. For example, you could snap the power source component,
the knob component, and the LED component, and as you turn the knob, the LED
will turn dimmer and brighter. littleBits has already developed all sorts of
creative bits, as they call them, to create a wide variety of electronic
circuits, including motion sensor inputs to DC motor outputs. You can see all
of them <a href="https://community.littlebits.cc/bits">here</a></p>

<h2>A thoughtful, innovative product</h2>

<p>I took some time to look through their website and think
about their product, and I&rsquo;m deeply impressed by what they&rsquo;ve been able to
create so far. Here&rsquo;s why I think littleBits is an amazing educational
product.</p>

<h3>No annoying obstacles to slow you down</h3>

<p>The most difficult thing when you start something new is often the small, but
numerous hurdles you must surpass as you begin. When you want to start
exercising, you have to find a gym, get a membership, and perhaps learn the basic
exercise movements. When you first learn to code, you may have to find the
right learning materials, install various applications, and get your
environment set up. In electronic circuits, you have to buy the right parts,
have a basic understanding of electricity (in particular Ohm&rsquo;s Law), and be
prepared to spend some frustrating time debugging your circuit. Each of
these small obstacles present opportunities for you to stop and just give up.</p>

<p>littleBits eliminates these tiny inhibitors and lowers the barrier for
children to begin playing with electronics. No more need to verify all your
breadboard connections and check your spec sheet to see that all the pins are
in the right places; littleBit&rsquo;s fantastic magentic snap ensures that your
connections are always correct! littleBits clearly worked hard to optimize on
this front, and I think their work will pay off, as younger children
have much less patience than adults, and even we have difficulty sticking
through with new things!</p>

<h3>A lower barrier to experimentation results in greater innovation</h3>

<p>The magnetic snap on the little bits allows you to quickly assemble and
disassemble the bits. This allows for children to easily experiment and build
all kinds of creative products. In the past decade, the ease with which
internet applications can now be built has resulted in an explosion in
innovation in the internet industry. Similarly, I believe littleBits will
enable many more children to create incredible toys and projects with
electronics than ever before.</p>

<h3>Quick trial and error allows for learning by exploration and discovery</h3>

<p>Most importantly, littleBits seems to have been designed for kids to learn
through exploration and discovery. I can imagine that most kids would be able
to pick up some littleBits and figure out how they work in a short amount of
time, just by putting things together and seeing how they work. I believe this
aspect of the product is perhaps most significant, because it results in
learning, without the children feeling like they&rsquo;re really learning anything
&mdash; it&rsquo;s just play to them! And that&rsquo;s the best kind of activity to foster
a life of intellectual curiosity and lifelong learning, because it
demonstrates that learning <em>is</em> fun.</p>

<h2>Still improvements to be made</h2>

<p>However, while thinking about the product, I found that there are still a few
areas in which littleBits could do better.</p>

<h3>Prohibitively expensive</h3>

<p>The biggest disappointment I had with littleBits was with their pricing. If
you buy the bits in kits, then they&rsquo;re about $9-10 per bit, and they are even
more expensive if you buy them individually. I&rsquo;m not an expert in electronics,
so it isn&rsquo;t clear to me what a reasonable price for these components would be,
but from the perspective of a consumer, littleBits is currently prohibitively
expensive. If I wanted to create a project with any moderate amount of
complexity, I&rsquo;m sure I would at least need one or two dozen bits, which would
end up costing me up to two hundred dollars! littleBits will have to bring
their prices down before they can tap into the mainstream consumer market.</p>

<h3>Memory modules will expand the range of projects</h3>

<p>I also worry that the set of bits that littleBits currently has doesn&rsquo;t offer
sufficient replay value to justify their costs. While they have a
simple model of power, input, output, and wiring modules, I would imagine that
one would quickly become bored of playing with the bits, because there
are only so many combinations that can be created.</p>

<p>What littleBits needs to do is add the fundamental concept of memory and
storage to their components. Doing so would explode the possibilities for what
could be created &mdash; the vast majority of electronic components today require
the use of memory, and the few that do not (e.g., a guitar amp) probably
couldn&rsquo;t easily be made with littleBits. Including memory would allow projects
to become stateful, opening a entire new world of applications.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>I commend the team behind littleBits for all the work they&rsquo;ve put into
creating such a simple and educational product. Simplifying a product is one
of the hardest things to do and especially so for engineers! I think
littleBits has the potential to be very successful in the future, but there
are still a few small things that I believe need to be resolved, but when they
do, I&rsquo;m sure they will have an outstanding market entrance.</p>
