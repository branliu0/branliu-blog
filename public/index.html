	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A few months ago, my friend put forth an interesting question: What happens
to the number of last names over time? It is common to hear about a family
name dying with a last descendant who never had any children. That suggests
that it is possible that in the future, we will all have just one of a handful
of last names, as most of them will have died off. Yet, I would expect that if
it could happen, it should have happened by now, or at the very least, I would
be able to discern some kind of sign suggesting a trend toward fewer last
names. But the number and diversity of last names on Earth is quite
remarkable, and it&rsquo;s still a uncommon thing for two unrelated people to meet
and have the same last name.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the spirit of curiosity, I decided to write a small Ruby script
that would simulate the progression of last names over many generations, just
to see what the end result might be. I had an enjoyable time exploring the
problem, and ended up with some interesting results.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: What non-technical classes at Harvard should a technical major
really consider taking?</p>

<p>I’ll suggest a few classes, but I’m going to focus on proposing a <strong>framework</strong> for
thinking about what non-technical classes would be most valuable for you to
take as a technical major. After all, every person is unique and would enjoy
their own particular set of classes!</p>

<p>I see at least three distinct reasons why you would want to take
a non-technical class. But I’d like to focus on the first one, because
I believe it’s the most important one to spend time thinking about. If you
don’t read everything, at least read this first section.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine introduced me to the amazing world of
<a href="http://littlebits.cc">littleBits</a>. I had been taking an electrical
engineering course last semester, spending lots of time in lab playing with
circuits, so I was especially excited to see such an innovative product that
made it so easy for kids to explore the world of electronics and build their
own toys out of them!</p>

<p>littleBits is like LEGOs for electronics: they have a variety of different
electrical components that snap together with magnetics to create all sorts of
different circuits. For example, you could snap the power source component,
the knob component, and the LED component, and as you turn the knob, the LED
will turn dimmer and brighter. littleBits has already developed all sorts of
creative bits, as they call them, to create a wide variety of electronic
circuits, including motion sensor inputs to DC motor outputs. You can see all
of them <a href="https://community.littlebits.cc/bits">here</a></p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Oftentimes when we having a conversation with a friend, and we are telling
a story about something that happened, we will refer to other people in the
story as “my friend,” “my other friend,” and so on, avoiding mentioning their
names. The logic is that it is probably better leave out the names, as they
would confuse the listener, who probably wouldn’t remember them anyway.</p>

<p>However, I’ve found that when I’m having a conversation with a good friend,
and we’re sharing a very personal story that is important to one of us, it
distances the listener when we avoid mentioning names, and instead continually
repeat a phrase like “my friend” or “my girlfriend” throughout the story.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In recent times, it seems that there has been continual negativity against
social media and social network-based entrepreneurship. They&rsquo;ve been
continually criticized for adding minimal value to society and being
opportunistic. Other times, they&rsquo;re viewed as young people who just want to
start a company for the sake of starting a company. Indeed, I agree that social
media and social network-based problems are not the most important issues that
our society faces today. I think that much of the criticism of the changed VC
landscape and the resulting short-termed thinking of investors is quite valid,
but I believe that the criticism sometimes goes a little far when it begins to
condemn the individuals who are starting these companies (which I&rsquo;ll refer to
for the rest of this post as social media startups).</p>

<p>The primary criticism of social media startups is that they are not adding much
value to society or the economy, and that their talents, capital, and efforts
would be much better spent solving &ldquo;real&rdquo; problems like education, energy, or
our healthcare system. While this is certainly true, it&rsquo;s also quite an unfair
criticism to make. Before giving any proper critique, one should always
consider the likely alternatives to the object of criticism &mdash; or else they
risk wasting their breath on something that can&rsquo;t be easily changed or being
unfair by criticizing something that, although flawed, turns out to be the
better than most other options. I believe that most criticism of social media
startups fails to do the latter.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>What makes someone a master of facilitating meetings?</p>

<p>When people teach others how to run effective meetings, they usually cover
specific meeting techniques that can be used. Here are some of the most
commons ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow everyone a chance to speak, and actively encourage reticent
participants.</li>
<li>Use an agenda, schedule each agenda item (as opposed to just listing
them), and send it out before the meeting.</li>
<li>Create a list of action items to follow up on after the meeting, with assigned
persons of responsibility and deadlines.</li>
</ul>


<p>Implementing these techniques will undoubtedly make your meetings more
effective, but I feel that these recommendations miss the high-level skills
that are often more subtle to articulate. The actions above will help anyone
become competent at running meetings, but there is much more that is needed to
become a true master at meetings.</p>

<p>Briefly, I discuss two skills I believe are core to any outstanding
meeting facilitator. While my points may be less actionable than many of the
techniques you can find online, I believe they provide a valuable framework
for evaluating yourself as an effective leader during meetings. Self-awareness
is the first step to personal growth!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been spending more time exploring the biotechnology startup world lately,
and it&rsquo;s quite interesting to see its many differences from the consumer web
startup world that I&rsquo;ve become familiar with. In particular, I&rsquo;ve noticed many
ways in which their executive teams differ in their structure and presentation
on websites.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to list some observations that I&rsquo;ve made, and then give
some explanations that will hopefully account for these observations. I&rsquo;ve
picked a few startup team pages that I&rsquo;ll be basing my observations on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Most .vimrc files that I’ve seen are quite long and unwieldy, often extending
to upwards of 300 lines of code. The .vimrc becomes a mess of code as it is
built up over the years, just a few lines at a time. Many people try to
resolve this issue by breaking the .vimrc down into sections, often with the
help of comments or fold markers. This makes it much easier to read, but it
isn’t a perfect solution. I still find myself having to scroll around the
.vimrc to find the line of I want to change or to find a place I can insert
a new line of vimscript.</p>

<p>There’s a much better solution for organizing the .vimrc, thanks to the
ability to source other vimscripts from within a vimscript. I’ve broken up my
own .vimrc file into 8 smaller files, and I include them into my main .vimrc
file by using the source function. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>

</span><span class='line'>  source $HOME/.vimrc.local
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">endif</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now each of my files are much smaller and easier to manage! It’s also quite
simple to navigate to each of these files. I’ve set up <leader>; to open up
a tab with the .vimrc, and then I can use vim’s handy gf action to open up the
file given by the filename under the cursor. I’ve included a nice way to allow
for local .vimrc additions as well.</p>

<p>Write a function that returns a random node from a linked list of unknown
length in <strong>O(1) space</strong> and <strong>O(n) time</strong>. (Finding a solution in O(1) time is
not only algorithmically interesting, but is also realistic if the linked list
is too large to fit in memory). You may only traverse through the linked list
<strong>once</strong> (i.e. you can&rsquo;t traverse it once to get the length of the list, then
again to pick a node).</p>

		<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make the best use of my time,
given my circumstances and where I am in life, and one of the most important
things that I&rsquo;ve had to think about is the division of time between school and
entrepreneurship. Given that I&rsquo;m passionate about entrepreneurship and deeply
involved on campus, it would make sense for me to be spending much of my free
time working on projects, generating ideas, and practicing entrepreneurship.
After all, school is a wonderful time to work on a startup, because you don&rsquo;t
need to be making a salary, you have so many talented and ambitious peers, and
in the worst case of your startup failing, you can always fall back to your
schoolwork.</p>

<p>But this semester, I&rsquo;ve made a deliberate effort to cut down on my projects and
entrepreneurial activities in order to focus on schoolwork. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot
and there are many reasons why I&rsquo;ve made this decision to focus more on
schoolwork, and one of those reasons is that I believe entrepreneurship is
nothing more than a means to an end, and not an end in itself, as many think.</p>
